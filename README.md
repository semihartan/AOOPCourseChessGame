# AOOPSemesterProject

This is a Chess Game that is written in Python using Pygame libtary for the semester project of the course Advanced Object Oriented Programming taken during 2022-2023 Autumn Semester at Yıldız Technical University.
It was initially private but later, I decided to open it to public so that others who are beginner could learn from it, both OOP techinques and Python.
